# Data-Mining-Techniques-to-predict-Depression-for-Mental-Health-Awareness

A 2012 survey conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO)
suggests that depression is a major public health issue that affects 350
million individuals globally. Depression when undiagnosed and untreated, is
detrimental to physical health, social relations and quality of life and can
also lead to self harm and suicide. Depression is a leading cause of
disability around the world and contributes greatly to the global burden of
disease. The effects of depression can be long-lasting or recurrent and can
dramatically affect a person's ability to function and live a rewarding life. It
is associated with disrupted biological rhythms caused by environmental
disturbance like seasonal change in daylight, alteration of social rhythms
due to for instance shift-work or longitude traveling; besides linked to
lifestyles associated with diurnal rhythms inconsistent with the natural
daylight cycle. Before depression can be effectively treated and it has to be
rightfully recognised. Recognising depression in patients is an ongoing
battle due to the complexity of several features used to correctly classify
depression. Moreover, the research on identifying depression through
motion sensing data is relatively new. In this project we seek to develop
various classifiers on a dataset of user information collected through a
general survey and motor activity data collected through a smartwatch to
find the best algorithm that results in the most accurate classification. Our
results will be really valuable in addressing key concerns in countering
depression.

[ For the purpose of this project, we would rely on the following definition of
Depression: A mental health disorder characterized by persistent feelings
of sadness or loss of interest in activities, causing significant impairment in
daily life. Possible causes include a combination of biological,
psychological and social sources of distress. ]
